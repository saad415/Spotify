## Advanced Technical Implementation

### Automated Data Pipeline
- **Spotify API Integration:** Utilized Python scripts hosted on an AWS EC2 instance to interface with the Spotify Web API, ensuring real-time data access.
- **AWS S3 Storage:** Configured AWS S3 buckets for secure and scalable storage of extracted data in CSV format.
- **Automated Data Refresh:** Established a cron job on the AWS EC2 instance to update CSV files daily, maintaining data relevancy and accuracy.

### Data Extraction and Storage
- **Data Retrieval:** Extracted comprehensive user and track data, including user profiles, playlists, and detailed audio features of tracks.
- **CSV Storage:** Efficiently compiled and organized data into CSV files for ease of processing and analysis.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Power BI Integration:** Employed Power BI for advanced data analysis and visualization, creating an interactive and dynamic user experience.
- **Custom Visualization:** Integrated HTML and Deneb within Power BI to showcase track images and visualize average track popularity.
